/* Algorithms must:
* have an order
* have clear instructions
* operations that can be done by a computer
* produce a result
* stop in a finite amount of time */

/* Why analyze algorithms?
* predict performance:
- does it work?
- will it work if...
* make decisions
* which algorithm best suits circumstance? */
